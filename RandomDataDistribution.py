#Random Data Distribution

#Generate a 1-D array containing 100 values, where each value has to be 3, 5, 7 or 9.

#The probability for the value to be 3 is set to be 0.1

#The probability for the value to be 5 is set to be 0.3

#The probability for the value to be 7 is set to be 0.6

#The probability for the value to be 9 is set to be 0

#Same example as above, but return a 2-D array with 3 rows, each containing 5 values.
